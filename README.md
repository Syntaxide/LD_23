Ant In Training
=====

About:
Ant in Training is my submission to LudumDare 23. LudumDare is a 48 hour game programming competition, so as you might expect a lot of this code isn't done in the best way possible, but is instead written that allowed me to change my mind frequently. When I started, I thought this was going to be a platformer. Then a motherload clone.

Competition page, which has a windows binary:

Technologies used:
C++ ( perhaps an unusual choice for this challenge, but it is the language most familiar to me )  
SDL  
PNG ( used drawing images, and as my map import/export format )
